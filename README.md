# CP1404 Practicals

This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the CP1404 Practicals from James Cook University.  
It is designed to showcase my learning progress and practice in Python programming, focusing on clean code principles and design patterns.

## About Me

I am Alex Wong, a student at James Cook University, studying Information Technology.  
Through these practicals, I am enhancing my skills in writing maintainable and well-structured Python code.

## Key Lessons About Clean Code

- **Consistent Naming:** Use clear and consistent variable, function, and class names that reflect their purpose.
- **Small, Focused Functions:** Break down tasks into small, single-responsibility functions to improve readability and reusability.
- **Code Formatting:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines for consistent code style, including indentation, spacing, and line length.
